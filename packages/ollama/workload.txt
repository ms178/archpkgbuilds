# Section 5: Summarization
"Summarize the following article on quantum computing in 200 words: Quantum computing promises to revolutionize computation by leveraging quantum mechanics. Unlike classical computers, which use bits to represent information as 0s or 1s, quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. This allows quantum computers to solve certain problems, such as factoring large numbers and simulating complex systems, exponentially faster than classical computers. Quantum entanglement, another key principle, enables qubits to be correlated in ways that classical bits cannot, further enhancing computational power. However, building practical quantum computers is challenging due to issues like qubit stability, error correction, and decoherence. Current quantum computers, such as those developed by IBM, Google, and Rigetti, are in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, with limited qubits and high error rates. Despite these challenges, applications in cryptography, drug discovery, and materials science are being explored. Governments and companies are investing heavily in quantum research, with initiatives like the U.S. National Quantum Initiative and the EU Quantum Flagship. As the technology matures, quantum computing could transform industries, but significant breakthroughs are still needed to achieve practical, large-scale quantum advantage. [This is a 1000-word article]."
"Summarize the key points of the following essay on AI ethics in 100 words: The rapid advancement of AI raises significant ethical concerns.

Autonomous weapons powered by AI pose risks of misuse and accountability. Additionally, AI-driven automation threatens jobs, exacerbating economic inequality. To address these issues, policymakers must develop frameworks for transparency, accountability, and fairness. Ethical AI development requires collaboration between technologists, ethicists, and regulators to ensure AI benefits society as a whole. [This is a 500-word essay]."
