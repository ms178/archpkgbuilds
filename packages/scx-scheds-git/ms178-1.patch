+	 *    1. Compiler won't optimize away the write
+	 *    2. Write is atomic (single instruction on x86-64)
+	 *    3. Memory barrier ensures visibility to other CPUs
+	 *
+	 *    Concurrent readers use READ_ONCE, which pairs with WRITE_ONCE
+	 *    to provide safe read-modify-write as long as there's only
+	 *    ONE writer (which is guaranteed: cpuc owner CPU).
+	 *
+	 * PERFORMANCE:
+	 * - WRITE_ONCE: ~10 cycles (MOV + memory barrier)
+	 * - fetch_add:  ~40 cycles (LOCK XADD, locks cache line)
+	 *
+	 * On 24-core system running compilation workload:
+	 * - 24 CPUs Ã 1000 ticks/sec Ã 30 cycle savings = 720,000 cycles/sec saved
+	 * - At 5 GHz: 0.144ms/sec = 0.0144% CPU time saved
