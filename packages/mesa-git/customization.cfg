# mesa-git-tkg config file


#### OPTIONS ####

# External config file to use - If the given file exists in path, it will override default config (customization.cfg) - Default is ~/.config/frogminer/mesa-git.cfg
_EXT_CONFIG_PATH=~/.config/frogminer/mesa-git.cfg

# Uncomment the MESA_WHICH_LLVM variable below to select which LLVM package tree to use by default to build mesa-git against.
# Note that if you're used to have that variable set in ~/.bashrc, you can leave it commented out here. It'll be respected by the PKGBUILD.
# Else, you'll get prompted about it at build time.
#
# 1: llvm-minimal-git (AUR)
# 2: llvm-git (AUR)
# 3: llvm-git from LordHeavy unofficial repo
# 4  llvm (stable from extra) Default value
MESA_WHICH_LLVM=2

# Set to "false" to skip cleanups. Default "true" will enable housecleaning and sanity tasks.
_NUKR="true"

# Compiler to use - gcc or clang - gcc is default
_compiler="clang"

# Custom GCC root dir - Leave empty to use system compilers.
# Example: CUSTOM_GCC_PATH="/home/frog/PKGBUILDS/mostlyportable-gcc/gcc-mostlyportable-9.2.0"

# Enable lib32.
_lib32=true

# Use local glesv2.pc - This is provided by libglvnd as of ab9b5fcc3bf90064418f6915cf4259fa11ffe64b.

# Which Gallium drivers to include in the build - default is "r300,r600,radeonsi,nouveau,svga,swrast,virgl,iris,zink,crocus".
# For users with a dedicated AMD GPU (RX 400 series and newer) the minimum required to get a working display driver is the "radeonsi,svga,swrast" combo
_gallium_drivers="radeonsi,swrast,zink"

# Which patent encumbered codecs to build support for - default is "vc1dec,h264dec,h264enc,h265dec,h265enc" (all of them)
# This is used for all video APIs (vaapi, vdpau, vulkan).

# Which Vulkan drivers to include in the build - default is "amd,intel,intel_hasvk".

# If you wanted to disable osmesa, uncomment the line below

# Whether to build Gallium XA tracker - set to "false" to disable.

# Custom optimization flags - optional.

# Disable `-D b_lto=true` that Arch-meson passes by default - set to "false" to enable LTO.
# Be aware that lto'ing mesa can lead to stability issues.
_no_lto="true"

# Set optional additional flags for meson - Defaults are "--strip --buildtype release"
# Can be used for PGO'ing (you need to make a first build with "-Db_pgo=generate" added, then launch your apps/games to generate the gcda profiles in your src dir. Once you feel like you have covered all your desired usecases, replace "-Db_pgo=generate" with "-Db_pgo=use" then rebuild the same commit to get your optimized build).
# (coupling with _no_lto="false" is recommended for PGO builds)
# For LLVM-PGO edit makepkg.conf with: 1) compile an instrumented Mesa with "-fprofile-generate=/home/marcus/Downloads/mesa-%p.profraw" 2) run some games which you want to profile, 3) merge the raw profiles in that directory with "llvm-profdata merge -output=mesa.profdata mesa-*.profraw" and 4) compile Mesa with "-fprofile-use=/home/marcus/Downloads/mesa.profdata"

# Same as above but only affecting the 64-bit side
# Useful if you want to use rusticl for example, with "-Dgallium-rusticl=true -Dllvm=enabled -Drust_std=2021" as it can't be built on the 32-bit side
_additional_meson_flags_64=""
# Same as above but only affecting the 32-bit side

# Custom Mesa commit to pass to Git.

_mesa_prs=""

# Mesa source to use. Default is "https://github.com/mesa3d/mesa.git"
# We're using the github mirror by default instead of "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa.git" due to gitlab slowness

#### LEGACY ####

# Which DRI drivers to include in the build - default is "i915,i965,r100,r200,nouveau" - this doesn't affect the "main" (default) branch

#### USER PATCHES ####

# Community patches - add patches (separated by a space) of your choice by name from the community-patches dir.
# Example: _community_patches="intel_haswell_vk_workaround.mymesarevert VK_JOSH_depth_bias_info_header.mymesapatch VK_JOSH_depth_bias_info_radv.mymesapatch".
_community_patches=""

# You can use your own patches by putting them in the same folder as the PKGBUILD and giving them the .mymesapatch extension.
# You can also revert patches by putting them in the same folder as the PKGBUILD and giving them the .mymesarevert extension.

# Also, userpatches variable below must be set to true for the above to work.
_user_patches="true"

# Apply all user patches without confirmation - !!! NOT RECOMMENDED !!!
